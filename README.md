## Summary
This project predicts the manner in which a set of individuals exercise. We use data from accelerometers on the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbell of 6 participants to create a predictive model. The data used is part of the http://groupware.les.inf.puc-rio.br/har effort.
The model was built using random forest and cross validated using the confusionMatrix command in R. The estimated out of sample error is 0.69%.
The model shows 0.991164 of accuracy and it was able to predict the 20 different test cases of the test data set.


## Files for Review
**For reviewing the project, I highly recommend to look at the pdf file : Prediction - Exercise Manner.pdf.**  

The Prediction - Exercise Manner.htlm and Prediction - Exercise Manner.Rmd have been loaded for completion, however are more cumbersome to review
